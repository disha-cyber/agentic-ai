Copy the full output string.

🔓 Complete Jenkins Setup

Open browser:

Create an admin user (username & password)

Finish setup and reach Jenkins dashboard


### Jenkins Initial Plugin Installation

On first launch, Jenkins automatically installs recommended plugins required for:
- Pipelines
- Git/GitHub integration
- Credentials management
- Build utilities

This process may take a few minutes depending on network speed.  
Green check marks indicate successful installation.  
Red entries usually resolve automatically as dependencies are installed.

After plugin installation, Jenkins prompts to create an admin user and then opens the dashboard.
